# How to to play :
run $python app.py in main directory

# Train a model for Neural Network AI :
- this process should happen for player x and player o separately. the code to the the following exists in app.py
1. create game logs by letting minimax AI play against a random AI
2. convert game logs to ml dataset
3. train model using dataset
4. note that you can continue training of a model too. the weights will update
5. save created models in models directory with these names: model_x and model_o
