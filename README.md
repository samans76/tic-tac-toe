### How To Play :

Run the following command in project directory
```bash
$ python app.py
```
<br>

---
### Train Neural Network Model :
This process should happen for player x and player o separately.<br>The code to the the following exists in app.py file.
1. Create game logs by letting minimax AI play against a random AI.
2. Convert game logs to ml dataset.
3. Train model using dataset.
4. Note that you can continue training of a model too. the weights will update.
5. Save created models in models directory with these names: model_x and model_o.
