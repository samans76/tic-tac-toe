### How to to play :

Run the following command in project directory
```bash
$ python app.py
```

### Train a model for Neural Network AI :
This process should happen for player x and player o separately. 
The code to the the following exists in app.py
1. Create game logs by letting minimax AI play against a random AI
2. Convert game logs to ml dataset
3. Train model using dataset
4. Note that you can continue training of a model too. the weights will update
5. Save created models in models directory with these names: model_x and model_o
